# BDD Climate Control Project

Historically, Ford has had high warranty expenses, more than most other main U.S. auto manufacturers. In 2019 alone, Ford paid out $4.56 billion in warranty claims. The Climate Control team, in particular, is striving to help reduce warranty spending by investigating faulty compressors and other customer claims relating to the AC system. Possible causes for these customer complaints include driving behavior, differences in actual and requested temperature, system blockages, and other extraneous factors (season, duration of trip, etc.).

## Objectives
1. Gain insights into large differences that exist between actual compressor temperature and temperature requested by passenger. 
2. Analyze the duration and frequency of intervals where the compressor temperature is below 0Â°C.
3. Determine if driver behavior impacts the AC system.
